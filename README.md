Good day!

This project was built by me during my media design studies and helped me to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The gameplay is very simple and probably boring to play after 2 minutes. But as a uni project it served me wonderfully. 

How to play:
Catch the apples for 10 points each. 
If you catch an orange or pear you will get a tiny broken heart.
Just like an octopus, you have 3 hearts in total. 
If you lose them all, the game is over. 
But don't worry - you can get a fresh start any time!

Have fun!

And keep track of your health - an apple a day... you know it :)
